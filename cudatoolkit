cudatoolkit is essential for many AI/ML applications. 

It can be installed either via `pip` or via the Conda environment. 

When installing via Conda (install tensorflow-gpu), Conda takes care of getting the right versions of CUDAtoolkit for the given/available version of tf-gpu. 

When installing via pip, the user has to figure all that themselves.

advantage - easier to manage and track dependencies

disadvantage - conda store *may not* have the latest version of dependencies.
